# my-portfolio

## Description

When applying for jobs or internships, it is immensely beneficial for the candidate to have a portfolio that shows off their skills through projects that they created or contributed greatly to. This was my motivation for creating this website; I want a place to show off all of my relevant work so that potential employers can see what I am capable of. Using the html, css, amd javascript skills that I have learned so far, I have complied a website that describes me and the work that I am proudest of. Through creating this website, I learned to apply my new css knowledge. I also practiced google fu skills whenever I wanted to add something new that I had never learned before or whenever I ran into a bug that my current knowledge was unable to solve. I was able to expand a solidfy my learning through this experience and I am excited to be able to share that with potential employers.
